# Commands:

look around

check pockets

sleep?

go through [door]

# Bugs

Command input overflows on Chrome/Edge? (saw when Almyki tried)

Look should print what directions doors are in.

Looking a direction through an open door should print what room is past it

Unlocking an already unlocked door

Prints "you cannot go to the [direction]" twice

`go up`: "you cannot go to the up"

# Note

Almyki wants me to hide a teddy bear in the game for her.
